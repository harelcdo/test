        Hi there! My name is Harel Cohen,<br>
        and I'm passionate about teaching guitar.<br>
        Originally from Ramat Hasharon, I've dedicated my life to sharing the joy of music with others.<br>
        I have a degree from Rimon School.<br>
        As a guitar teacher, I believe that everyone has the potential to learn and excel at playing the guitar,<br> 
        regardless of their age or skill level.<br>
        With years of experience and a deep love for music,<br> 
        I strive to create a supportive and enjoyable learning environment for my students.
    </p>
